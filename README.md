# Word Meaning Search
This is a simple app developed to extract meaning of words using duckduckgo API. It stores every word searched in a database and prints the frequency of the word searched maximum no of times.

It was made so that I could play around with APIs, JSON and databases.
####Instructions to run:
  1. Save connection.inc.sample as connect.inc.php and change variables according to your database settings.
  2. Enter the word you want to search (Obviously!)
